- **FPV Camera**: Features a fixed front-facing camera for immersive first-person navigation.
- **Obstacle Detection and Avoidance**: Utilizes ultrasonic sensors with a broad field of view (120°–160°) to ensure reliable environmental awareness.
- **Driving Modes**:
  - *Autonomous Mode*: Enables the vehicle to dynamically follow the remote control while avoiding static and dynamic obstacles.
  - *Manual Override*: Grants full user control, with real-time safety features enabled.
  - *Docking Mode*: Automatically aligns and connects to a charging station with precision guidance.
- **Remote Control Interface**: Includes an F1-inspired wheel design featuring:
  - Dual joysticks for vehicle and camera control.
  - Button-based telemetry and camera feed toggling.
  - Comprehensive real-time telemetry display.
- **Telemetry Features**:
  - A primary display for the 360° camera feed, complemented by FPV in a picture-in-picture (PIP) layout.
  - Advanced sensor visualization mimicking automotive reversing systems, with animated proximity alerts.
  - Battery level monitoring for both the vehicle and the remote control.

## Hardware Specifications
